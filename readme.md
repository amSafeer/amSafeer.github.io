## A little project by Safeer


This clone is a replica of the Facebook login page. It includes:

- An uncompleted footer :)

I have hosted this website, however, **Chrome and some other browsers** have marked my website as ***dangerous.*** This is false, as I have no viruses on it. You can literally **check the code** lol.
